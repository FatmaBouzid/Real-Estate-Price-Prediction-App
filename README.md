This project is a Real Estate Price Prediction application designed to estimate property prices based on input features. It leverages three machine learning models for prediction:

* **Linear Regression**
* **Lasso Regression**
* **Decision Trees**
  
The application is built using **Flask**, providing a user-friendly interface for users to input property details and get instant price predictions.
